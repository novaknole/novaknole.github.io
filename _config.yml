#An additional info freetext section is optional at the bottom of the page - can be text or HTML

   <strong>Web</strong>: I will go in depth details in what kind of things I've had experience while working for the projects I mentioned above:<strong>how to: </strong>handle more than 10M rows in mysql, mongodb and redis,  make optimization and indexes and make them super fast, write OOP code and restful apis, use PDO prepared statements in php, secure linux servers, caching, nginx-proxy, creating a pool server like antpool.com from almost scratch so that bitcoin,litecoin miners can connect to my pool and mine their hardwares(I've used redis database and managed it so that it can handle more than Billion rows), Master-slave replications, AOF, supervisord,Node.js cluster workers(since it's single threaded) and so much more. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Destkop</strong>:My destkop experience is related to awesome Languages:Java, C, C++. I've had experience in the following things: <strong>How to </strong>write testable code(dependency injection, law of diameter, loose coopling over tight coopling, polymorphism), use JUNIT tests(understanding of statement, path, branch coverage), black-box and white-box testing, deep understanding of stack, heap, assembly, registers, multi-threading(threads,proccesses,concurenncy,parallelism,locks, deadlocks,busy waiting, how to avoid them, how to write thread-safe code, taking adventage of lock objects ,using syncrhonized keywords), generic classes(cloning objects,elements) and so much more I can't even cover it on this website :)<br/><br/>
   <strong>Mobile</strong>:Unfortunatelly, I've never worked with native apps as for now. I've used ionic and cordova frameworks to write hybrid apps. I've had experience with so many things that modern apps have implemented within their apps. With ionic, I've integrated mobile tracking system for ios and android respectively. It uses accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer to detect when the device is moving and stationary and also It's a battery-conscious motion-detection. </br></br>
   I'm so happy If you got interested. I'm Giorgi and I'm from Georgia, Tbilisi. It's been 3 years since I started learning programming. Since that time, I've never stopped improving myself and always try to do more and more. In these 3 years, I made the impossible. Who'd have imagined that I'd know so many stuff described above? The reason is I never give up and always strive to fulfil my dreams. My favorite Quote is: "If you come to play, you come to play real hard or get the hell off my court!". </br></br>
   As for now, I don't even stop and Nobody can even stop me. Even though it's been 3 years and no more, I'm 100% sure that there's nothing, no web/mobile/desktop application I can't write with outstanding quality code. If it's harder more than my abilities, Then I amn't gonna sleep until I figure out the best way to solve it, Because I prefer success over sleep. I prefer to be working when others are sleeping.</br></br>
   SO MOTIVATED TO CHANGE THE WORLD, BECAUSE I WAS HERE
