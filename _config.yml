   <strong>WEB DEVELOPMENT</strong>: I will go in depth details in what kind of things I've had experience while working for the projects I mentioned above: How to handle more than 10M rows in mysql, mongodb and redis, <strong>how to: </strong> make optimization and indexes and make them super fast, write OOP code, secure linux servers >
   <strong>Destkop</strong>: My server side web development experience has largely been based on the Spring MVC framework (although current role uses ColdFusion for server side web stack). I have also worked with some client side technology, having used jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS and have also experimented with other interesting technologies such as Backbone/Underscore/Require.<br/><br/>
  
   I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Android, a variety of social APIs (Twitter etc) and cloud platforms such as CloudFoundry/OpenShift/AppFog/Parse. <br/><br/>
   As part of Nerdability, I created, and am now primary contributor to, two Spring projects - <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/robhinds/spring-social-geeklist">Spring-Social-Geeklist</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nerdability/spring-social-khan-academy">Spring-Social-Khan-Academy</a>, which provide core integration with those third-party APIs on top of the Spring Social framework. They are both listed as community projects: <a target='_blank' href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/">http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/</a>. <br/><br/>
   I write a blog covering technical and opinion articles that can be found here: <a target='_blank' href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/">automateddeveloper.blogspot.com</a> (I am also a <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/users/899489/rhinds.html">DZone MVB</a>)
